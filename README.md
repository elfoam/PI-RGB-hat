# PI-RGB-hat
RGB Hat for Raspberry pi
This is a work in progress, it's based on an old RGB hat design that's based on the VGA 666 board. This is untested but I'll update to confirm it working in a few weeks, if not I'll fix it in the next revision.
The only thing here is the gerbers but the build is simple, remember to populate the resistors on one side only, through hole or surface mount.

If anyone would like to improve on it or add an RGB to component section on a larger board that would be great.

This board is confirmed working, other than the audio jack, I had no time to try configuring it but the baord is working and the sound is fine from the audio jack on the PI.
