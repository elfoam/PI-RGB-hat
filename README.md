# PI-RGB-hat
RGB Hat for Raspberry pi
This is a work in progress, it's based on an old RGB hat design that's based on the VGA 666 board. This is untested but I'll update to confirm it working in a few weeks, if not I'll fix it in the next revision.
The only thing here is the gerbers but the build is simple, remember to populate the resistors on one side only, through hole or surface mount.
